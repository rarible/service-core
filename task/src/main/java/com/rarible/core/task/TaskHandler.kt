 * Background handler of tasks of a specific [type]. Tasks are run by [TaskService].
 * There may be several tasks of this type with different `param` running in the background simultaneously.
 * Task is unique by a [type] and `param` with which it was started.
 * Task completion state returned from [runLongTask] and is recorded in the database to resume execution from the last state.
 *
 * Override this interface in a class marked with `@Component` or `@Service`.
 * Spring will pick up and register this handler automatically.
 *
 * There are 2 options how to schedule this task for execution:
 * - run [TaskService.runTask] with `type` parameter equal to this handler's [type] and a parameter to run with.
 * - override [getAutorunParams] with non-empty list of params. [TaskService] will schedule the task for execution
 * after a fixed delay on the application startup (usually after 30 seconds).
